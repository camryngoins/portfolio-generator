# portfolio-generator

## description
This project was assigned by MSU Coding Bootcamp, and was created using JavaScript, Node.js, and ES6. 

This project will generate your own personalized portfolio, using the npm "Inquirer" to prompt questions about yourself and your projects, and then they will be copied to the HTML file where they are then displayed on the application! 

To view this application, please clone the repository to your local device and then follow the question promot. Once you are done, just open the HTML and your own personal portfolio will be generated!
